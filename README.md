# LongestIncreasingSubstring
Code challenge
The project takes a file as an input (located at LongestIncreasingSubstring/LongestIncreasingSubstring/Input.txt) of any number of integers separated by single whitespace and outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence.
If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. You may develop supporting functions as many as you find reasonable.
